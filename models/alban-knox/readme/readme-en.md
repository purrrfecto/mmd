## English ver
### v1.1.0
- from v1.1.0, sphere map would be on by default. If you want it turn it off, please use those morph with "SPHOFF" at the end.
  - SPHOFF：コート、パーカー、ズボン、プロテクター

### v1.0.0
- Use 「morph：背中凹ませ」to fix the penetration on the back, it is recommeneded to keep it on when you have the coat on.
- Use 「morph：コートなし」to take off the coat, don't forget to turn off 「morph：背中凹ませ」
- morph with "AL" in the name means you can use MME's AutoLumious4 to make it glow

## Known issues
- ~~with MME on there are some weird shadow around the armpit area on the coat, I don't know how to fix it, if you really hate it you can turn off MME.~~ Seems like to be problem with HgSpotlight, may want to avoid using it together
