- ref: [https://blenderartists.org/t/editing-the-basis-shape-key-after-making-shapekeys/583561](https://blenderartists.org/t/editing-the-basis-shape-key-after-making-shapekeys/583561 "smartCard-inline")
- select Basis from the shape key menu
- fix the mesh in Edit mode
- with all edited vertices still selected, press Ctrl+V and choose “Propagate To All Shapes”
- Return to object mode and examine the remaining shapes to make sure that everything happened as you expected.
- **Remember that you cannot add or delete vertices, edges or faces when you do this. You can only move, rotate or scale existing ones.**
