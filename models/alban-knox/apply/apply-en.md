## english ver
Thanks for the interest! This is my first time making a model for distribution, so I would not recommend anyone new to MMD to try it. IT WOULD BE PAINFUL.

Due to the complexity of MMD and vtuber fanart culture, I have to verify a few things before giving out the model.
Also, by applying and downloading, you agreed the [Term of Use](../tos/tos-en.md).

Please provide the following if still interested:
- a public Twitter account (protected account could not be added to the list per twitter limitation)
- a link of your MMD video/image published on either public media website (e.g. niconico/youtube/twitter, etc.) that did not violate any rights and rules **and truly belongs to you** (e.g. it has your twitter account somewhere in description or so)
- a link to VOD or clip that mentioned NijiEN member you like
- a link to the bowroll profile you would use to download the file

Please DM me directly on [twitter](https://twitter.com/hokekyooo)! 

Once your eligibility is confirmed, your account would be added to a Twitter list, which includes the link to the download instructions.
